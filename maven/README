TODO List

-Integrate nu.htmlparser as a maven dependency
I will probably either create project object models for nu.htmlparser or upload it as a static release to a maven repoistory

-Create a artifact friendly way of re-introducing extensions
This might involve simply replicating what the ant build does by removing certain source files
